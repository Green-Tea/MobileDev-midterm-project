# Pain Point
We all have to eat dinner right? But sometimes we just can't figure out what we want to eat, or our partner can't agree on something to eat. <br/>
I made this app so that I can compare images of my favorite foods and hopefully at the end, the remaining food item that won against the others will be the meal that I want to eat tonight. <br/>
The main design is that the screen will be divided into two images. The user will then press on the image that is more appealing, then the other image will be replaced. The user will repeat this until there is no more images left to replace and will then be shown a results screen with the last image that was pressed. If it works as intended, that image should be the person's favorite at the moment.
